##### From sources
For compiling plik from sources, you need a functionnal installation of Golang, and npm installed on your system.

First, get the project and libs via go get
```sh

$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/root-gg/plik/
```

As root user you need to install grunt, bower, and setup the golang crosscompilation environnement :
```sh
$ sudo -c "npm install -g bower grunt-cli"
$ sudo -c "client/build.sh env"
```

And now, you just have to compile it
```sh
$ make build
$ make clients
```

### API
Plik server expose a REST-full API to manage uploads and get files :

Creating upload and uploading files :
 
   - **POST**        /upload
     - Params (json object in request body) :
      - oneshot (bool)
      - removable (bool)
      - ttl (int)
      - login (string)
      - password (string)
     - Return :
         JSON formatted upload object.
         Important fields :
           - id (required to upload files)
           - uploadToken (required to upload files)

   - **GET** /upload/:uploadid:
     - Get upload metadatas (files list, upload date, ttl,...)

   - **POST** /upload/:uploadid:/file
     - Body must be a multipart request with a part named "file" containing file data
   Returning a JSON object of newly uploaded file
   
   - **DELETE** /upload/:uploadid:/file/:fileid:
     - Delete file from the upload. Upload must have "removable" option enabled.
 
Get files :

  - **HEAD** /file/:uploadid/:fileid:/:filename:
    - Returning only HTTP headers. Usefull to know Content-Type and Content-Type of file without downloading it. Especially if upload has OneShot option enabled.

  - **GET**  /file/:uploadid/:fileid:/:filename:
    - Download specified file from upload. Filename **MUST** be right. In a browser, it will try to display file (if it's a jpeg for example). You can force download with dl=1 in url.

  - **GET**  /file/:uploadid/:fileid:/:filename:/yubikey/:yubikeyOtp:
    - Same as previous call, except that you can specify a Yubikey OTP in the URL if the upload is Yubikey restricted.


Examples :
```sh
Create an upload (in the json response, you'll have upload id and upload token)
$ curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:8080/upload

Create a OneShot upload
$ curl -X POST -d '{ "OneShot" : true }' 127.0.0.1:8080/upload

Upload a file to upload
$ curl -X POST --header "X-UploadToken: M9PJftiApG1Kqr81gN3Fq1HJItPENMhl" -F "file=@test.txt" 127.0.0.1:8080/upload/IsrIPIsDskFpN12E/file

Get headers
$ curl -I 127.0.0.1:8080/file/IsrIPIsDskFpN12E/sFjIeokH23M35tN4/test.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Disposition: filename=test.txt
Content-Length: 3486
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

```


### FAQ

##### I have an error when uploading from client : "invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value"

Under nginx < 1.3.9, you must enable HttpChunkin module to allow transfer-encoding "chunked".

For debian, this module is present in the "nginx-extras" package

And add in your server configuration :

```sh
        chunkin on;
        error_page 411 = @my_411_error;
        location @my_411_error {
                chunkin_resume;
        }
```


### Participate

You are free to implement other data/metadata/shorten backends and submit them via
pull requests. We will be happy to add them in the future releases.
